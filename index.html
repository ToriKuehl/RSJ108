Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

TASK 2
=======================================================
Add your introduction to your step-by-step-guide, including a title, time required to complete the activity, and a rating of how awesome the activity is. 
** Be careful to keep all the HTML tags intact when you are changing the text.

            <h1>How to Network Your Way to Success</h1>

            <p>Sometimes, it isn’t what you know but who you know that gets you where you want to be. Networking can seem like an overwhelming task, but it’s really just a fancy business term for getting to know people. By forming positive, genuine connections with people, your network will grow naturally over time. Remember, if you’re on the hunt for new opportunities or openings, there’s nothing wrong with reaching out to the folks at the top of their game to pick their brain or ask them questions.</p>

              <p>If you’re just starting out, connect professionally with your inner circle. Let them know you’re looking for work, trying to get a business venture off of the ground, or seeking new clients. Whatever it is, your friends and family will be able to help connect you to people they know and point you in the right direction.

              <p>Start by adding everyone you know, then move on to common connections. So, you might add an old coworker and then see they work with someone in your dream field. Add that person and send them a little note. In today’s world, LinkedIn is an essential tool. If you aren’t on LinkedIn yet, make a profile and start adding the people you know!</p>

              <h3>Attend job fairs and professional events.</h3>
              <p>Look online to scout out networking opportunities in your area. If you graduated recently, ask your alma mater’s career center for a list of job fairs. Attend every event you can. Dress sharp, bring a stack of resumes or business cards, and get to mingling! Depending on the event and what you’re looking for, you can hand off resumes, chat people up about the services you offer, or just casually talk to people to get to know some new folks.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Start collecting business cards.</h3>
              <p>Never discount anyone and hold on to every contact you make. If someone makes an effort to hand you a business card or contact sheet, it means they’re open to a professional relationship. Even if you’re in sales, you never know when you may need advice from a marketing guru, or get the inside scoop on an opening from a logistics manager.</p>

<li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Ask your peers and coworkers for introductions.</h3>
              <p>Your stronger connections can broker big meetings for you. For example, if you want to run a company one day, ask a close connection to set up a meeting with their CEO for you. If you want to get into coding, ask your engineering friend to connect you with the software team at their firm. People are more likely to meet with you if you come recommended from a trusted source, and this is a great way to network vertically to meet people higher up on the ladder than you are.</p> 
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Play it cool during informal chats.</h3>
              <p>If a contact doesn’t seem interested in talking business, don’t push. Just keep the conversation going and treat it like a normal chat. A lot of people prefer some small talk before they start chatting about business. That’s okay. You’re more likely to build a meaningful connection if you meet them on their terms. Forget the business jargon, sales pitches, or resumes. Just connect with them through your informal conversation. You can always build on that rapport in the future.</p> 
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Ask a lot of open-ended questions.</h3>
              <p>If you find it kind of hard to connect with someone, questions are your best friend. Once the conversation reaches a standstill, throw out a question like, “So how has business been for you recently?” or, “How did you get into financial consulting?” This will give the other person an opportunity to speak about themselves and guide the conversation. People respond well when other people seem interested in them, and asking questions is a great way to demonstrate that you’re invested and genuine.</p> 
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Find common ground and lean into it.</h3>
              <p>People tend to gravitate towards people they share something with. When you’re networking, look for those little connections. If they mention a sports team you enjoy, guide the conversation to spend a few minutes talking about playoffs and draft picks. If you went to the same university, chat it up about your shared experiences. Everything from places you’ve traveled to the suit that you’re wearing can be used to build a connection.</p> 
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Follow up with people you meet.</h3>
              <p>A few days after meeting someone, shoot them an e-mail or call them. Remind them how you met and throw in a genuine note about getting to know them better in the future. This will make your one-off interaction stick out in their head, and they’ll be more likely to remember you in the future. This can pay serious dividends if any opportunities pop up on their end.</p>
